# Cross-Cultural Analytics Project (CUHK)

**Cross-Cultural Analytics** is a research initiative led by **Professor Stuart M. McManus** (Department of History, The Chinese University of Hong Kong). The project is funded by the **2025/26 RGC Collaborative Research Fund – Young Collaborative Research Grant (YCRG)** and aims to establish Hong Kong as a leading global centre for computational cultural analysis. [1](https://unora.unior.it/handle/11574/252160?mode=simple)

## Overview

This project examines how **Chinese culture influenced Europe and the Americas between 1550 and 1900**, using methods that bring together data science and the humanities. We integrate:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Knowledge Graphs**
- **Big Data analytics**
- **Rare book digitisation**
- **Computational philology**
- **Intertextual modelling**

Our goal is to build new digital infrastructure for studying long-range cultural exchange and to support the future development of a permanent Cross-Cultural Analytics research centre at CUHK. [1](https://unora.unior.it/handle/11574/252160?mode=simple)

## What This Repository Contains

This repository hosts materials related to the Cross-Cultural Analytics project, including:

- Data schemas and sample corpora  
- NLP pipelines and reproducible workflows  
- Tools for text alignment, multilingual OCR, and semantic search  
- Knowledge Graph construction scripts  
- Experimental notebooks using LLMs for historical text analysis  
- Documentation for collaborative research and student training

## Research Goals

The project aims to:

1. **Build a high-quality textual corpus** from CUHK’s rare book collections and public-domain sources. [1](https://unora.unior.it/handle/11574/252160?mode=simple)  
2. **Apply LLMs and knowledge graphs** to track the movement of Chinese ideas across continents.  
3. **Model cross-cultural influence** using intertextual, semantic, and citation analysis.  
4. **Support new historical questions** that cannot be answered through traditional close reading alone.  
5. **Train students and researchers** in responsible, methodologically rigorous digital humanities.
